I tried to use one different phone to log in. It works.

It fails for me to use one different proxy address of VPN which doesn't solve the above problem.

As reference, the formula is derived in https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/CLP-1_Differential_Calculus_(Feldman_Rechnitzer_and_Yeager)/06%3A_Appendix/6.03%3A_C-_Root_Finding/6.3.02%3A_C.2_The_Error_Behaviour_of_Newton's_Method (almost same as https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/m120/newtConv.pdf) by "Subtracting (E2) from (E1)". Here the question may assume both derivatives are positive ($f''(\epsilon_n)\neq 0$ to ensure we will continue iteration and $f'(x_n)\neq 0$ since it is the denominator).

IMHO Here if $b_n$ is too negative, then "the estimate of the number of digits doubles each time" doesn't hold. We need to take $b_n$ into consideration as the libretexts link https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/CLP-1_Differential_Calculus_(Feldman_Rechnitzer_and_Yeager)/06%3A_Appendix/6.03%3A_C-_Root_Finding/6.3.02%3A_C.2_The_Error_Behaviour_of_Newton's_Method says "You can see why from (E5). Since ..." although the main idea is still same.

Thanks. As indicated in your answer, my wrong calculation for $\frac1x\frac{\mathrm{d}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}}{\mathrm{d}x}$ should have the sum index starting from $1$ instead of $0$.

Correct calculation:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac1x\frac{\mathrm{d}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}}{\mathrm{d}x}&=\frac1x\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k\cdot2k}{(2k+1)!}x^{2k-1}\\
&=\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k\cdot2k}{(2k+1)!}x^{2k-2}\\
&=\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(-x^2)^{k-1}\cdot(-2k)}{(2k+1)!}\\
&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-x^2)^k\cdot(-1)\cdot(2k+2)}{(2k+3)!}\\
&=\frac{-1}{2k+3}\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-x^2)^k}{(2k+1)!}.\end{align*}
$$
The original post
$$
\begin{align*}
&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty k\cdot (-x^2)^{k-1}\cdot(\frac{-2x}x)\cdot\dfrac1{(2k+1)!}\\&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty(-2k)\cdot(-x^2)^{k-1}\dfrac1{(2k+1)  
!}\\&\neq P_1(x)\end{align*}
$$
should be 
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty(-2k)\cdot(-x^2)^{k-1}\dfrac1{(2k+1)!}&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty(-1)\cdot(2k+2)\cdot(-x^2)^{k}\dfrac1{(2k+3)!}\\
&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty\frac{-1}{2k+3}\cdot(-x^2)^{k}\dfrac1{(2k+1)!}
\end{align*}
$$

Could I ask one small question? Here it is fine by omitting $\left(-\frac1x\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^n\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ for proof when saying about $P_n(x)$. Then why do you explicitly say that (are there some tricky ideas behind that and the relation between derivatives and the continued fraction)?

# reading order recommendation with other books
- better read *pure* "Computer Architecture" (So not csapp) before SICP if having learnt other programming languages like C.
  Also read maths before SICP although not needed to be as deep as mcs.pdf.
  - maths will help understand something like 
    1. Figure 1.5
# book reading order
- The reading order:
  book with footnotes -> em -> check "to reread after reading later chapters" -> exercise
## em tracking when reading the book (Read before doing the related exercises)
- up to exercise 1.35 finished
## to reread after reading later chapters (strikethrough to mark already read)
tracked up to section 1.2 (included) by searching "chapter" and "section".
### 1.2
- ~~> You may wonder why anyone would care about raising numbers to the 1000th power. See Section 1.2.6.~~
### 1.3
- ~~chapter 1 footnote 12~~
  > to create procedures without naming them, and to give names to procedures that have already been created. We will see how to do this in Section 1.3.2.
  ~~footnote 21~~
  > In Section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton’s method in general
- ~~> Notice that we have used *block structure (Section 1.1.8) to embed* the definitions of pi-next and pi-term within pi-sum, since these procedures are unlikely to be useful for any other purpose. We will see how to *get rid of them altogether* in Section 1.3.2.~~
### 2
- > In Chapter 2, when we investigate how to implement rational-number arithmetic, we will need to be able to compute s in order to reduce rational numbers to lowest terms.
- chapter 1 footnote 23.
- > We will return to these ideas in Section 2.2.3 when we show how to use sequences as interfaces
- > We’ll see examples of this aer we introduce data structures in Chapter 2.
### 3
- chapter 1 footnote 9, 16(also with *Chapter 4*), 27, 31
- > As we shall see in Chapter 3, the general notion of the environment
- 
  > We will discuss this more fully in Chapter 3 and *Chapter 4* when we examine the implementation of an interpreter in detail.
  > we will investigate some of its implications in Chapter 3 and *Chapter 4*
- > In particular, when we address in Chapter 3 the use of procedures with “mutable data,”
- > We’ll see how to use this as the basis for some fancy numerical tricks in Section 3.5.3.
### 4
- chapter 1 footnote 20
- > We will return to this issue in section 4.1.6, after we learn more about evaluation.
- > *requires reserving storage for a procedure’s free variables* even while the procedure is *not executing*. In the Scheme implementation we will study in Section 4.1, these variables are stored in the procedure’s environment.

I skipped [Problem Sets](https://github.com/abrantesasf/sicp-abrantes-study-guide?tab=readme-ov-file), Exam, homework and Quizzes because IMHO those numerous exercises in the book is enough and most of courses pay more attention for projects when grading. Also

    > The *next step* is to read Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
  - Discussion group is piazzza which only university students can access.

  - recommends "You should try to complete the *reading assignment* for each week *before the lecture*.".
    - Although for mit OCW, it may [be not that case](https://qr.ae/psxpwo) written by one MIT student.
      > I will rarely read the textbook unless some combination of the following is true: (1) I am very confused or lack the requisite background, (2) I am specifically told to do so by the professor, (3) the textbook is *highly recommended* by people I know who *took the class* before, (4) I have *time* on my hands.
      > When I’m not taking the corresponding class in person, I take a similar approach to reading the book, but *only after I’ve watched the lectures and read through the notes*. ... I’d resort to notes from *other professors* (sometimes not from MIT) before I’ll read the book.
      for exam
      > , reading the textbook first would *help immensely*, but it’s *not as efficient* because I’ll learn a lot more about *what the professor thinks is important* by reading/watching material directly produced by him or her.
    - It [depends on the student habits](https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/11d9ap0/comment/ja7d7a5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

### TODO
- Course information handout
  - > Unlike the homework and projects, the *tests* in this course (except for the parts specifically designated as group parts) must be your own, individual work

  kw: metaprogramming, macros, 
  > This is something you can't even dream of doing in most (all?) languages that *aren't dialects of LISP*.
  - [2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9843053)
    > The first 1/3 of CS61A in scheme had *no mutation*. That is almost impossible in Python to do, and is not the way the language is used in industry
    Python is to help the majority of struggling students
    > but perhaps fail to grasp some of the more complex concepts ... 80% of the material hasn't changed but you've gained the above benefits
    > If you understood the intricacies of what *was* taught in CS61A, you will find it very easy to *generalize* those concepts to *new languages* - and new concepts.
So I skip [this python lesson 6.100](https://introcomp.mit.edu/spring24/information)
### lab
recommended since the course general information shows (more detailed see 1.md)
> Laboratory exercises are short, relatively simple exercises designed to *introduce a new topic*.

  since we drop the others
  1. > all book exercises which cover the homework
  2. > I prefer doing the project assignments from MIT 6.5151
  3. > it is a bit overkill to do all these sample exams
## cs61as
The latest should be CS "61AS" spring 2016 since 'CS "61AS" fall 2016' has nothing.
I only check labs without checking Homework, Quizzes and Retakes
- Syllabus
  - uses Racket
  - > Lessons also link to external readings drawn from *SICP and old CS 61A lecture notes*'
  - "Units" shows the corresponding book chapters.
- Suggested Schedule & All Deadlines don't give project corresponding chapters
  So by Syllabus and textbook, maybe project x corresponds to chapter x.
- FAQ doesn't have much about what to be learnt.
- the following needs university student account
  - Discussion Worksheets and Solutions
- Webcasts fails now.
- Legacy Resources -> Lecture Notes may point to cs61a
- [Environment Diagram Drawer](https://cs61a.org/assets/pdfs/reverse-ed.pdf)
### reading
- > Lessons also link to external readings drawn from SICP and old CS 61A lecture notes. It is highly recommended that you complete *these readings before starting the lesson* material.
# How to learn
## project
- "lab exercises, computer examples" may [be important](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/151857)
## book vs lecture
- better [not drop the textbook with only lectures left](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/which-is-more-effective-for-learning-textbook-or-lecture-notes.467145/post-3105007) after *considering time*
  Also [see](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/which-is-more-effective-for-learning-textbook-or-lecture-notes.467145/post-3105014)
  > The only thing I feel professors are good for is *answering questions* which are *not fully answered* in the textbook.
  - Also see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/13jq1b8/comment/jkgkcee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which means *book & exercises* is better with its following comments. (Also see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/13jq1b8/comment/jkgozm5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which recommends the book and Roneitis's comment)
- [~~This lecture~~](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19887732) means live lectures
## video
- what video [actually needs to do](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/52758)
  > The advantage of the human teacher is that I *can ask questions*, but of course a video teacher cannot answer. There are cases, of course, where a video is superior to a printed book: a video can *show action* that a book can only describe or perhaps show still photos. So if you want to learn how to *perform some physical action*, like how to play golf or replace a transmission filter or whatever, a video might be able to show you in ways that *a book could not.*
- video lectures should [not be dependent more than the book](https://qr.ae/psJ39d). 
  Also [see](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8tn6pv/comment/e18s63p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
  - [this](https://qr.ae/psJBAi) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/oll49b/comment/h5g0fel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) says video is *only as one companion* but not the main part.
## summary
- [detailed][academia_se_tips]
  1. not drop one part artificially.
  2. better read the *lecture before* the book to get the *main idea*
  3. spend "~90% of their time working problems". (Although ~90 may be too high for actual course learning.)
- choose [the favorable method](https://mitili.mit.edu/news/compared-reading-how-much-does-video-improve-learning-outcomes) to learn
  > Likewise, those who *preferred to read and did read* scored nearly 10 percent *higher* on the post assessment than participants in the video group who would have preferred to read.

# How Do I learn SICP
- I read
  - lectures (I skipped Recitation because they are only review with no new knowledge to teach) first as [academia_se_tips] point 2 shows.
    - 6.037 (not read "With slide transitions" which is for lecture ppt instead of self-study)
    - 6.001 2007
  - read the book
  - use video when unable to understand
- For SICP book, I didn't revisit the book back for something like

  See [this][Fib_complexity] 
  If seeing it as the binary tree, $O(2^n)$ is trivial. More specifically, the deepest leef is the path following $(fib (- n 1))$ up to 1. So the maximum node number is the maximum time complexity (trace back from the leaf, due to `+ O(1)` each node contributes `O(1)` time. Then the time complexity is `O(1)*node_num`) $(2^0+\ldots+2^{n-1})\cdot O(1)=(2^n-1)\cdot O(1)$.
  More strictly, we can let $k=O(1)$, then just solve the recurrence relation.

  This is already said in DMIA "ALGORITHM 4 Recursive Modular Exponentiation.".
  Iterative see "ALGORITHM 5 Fast *Modular* Exponentiation." and mcs "6.3.1 Fast Exponentiation".
  Although they are for *Modular* Exponentiation.
  - In a summary `xy` in mcs just counts the corresponding $1000\ldots 0$. 
    Or we can see each `x` as the *minimum unit* after `quotient(z,2)`. So `xy` will count that minimum unit.
    `z = 0` means we have counted all bits.
- See **footnote** 37 for a *precise* calculation of the complexity.
  - > equal to 1 less than the log base 2 of n
    IMHO here should be $\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor$ instead of $\log_2 n - 1$.
    For example, $10\xRightarrow{s(quare)}1\xRightarrow{*}0$ so $2=\log_2(0b10)$ multiplications
    Then $11\xRightarrow{*}10\ldots$ so add 1 due to one 1 for the *odd* case.
    > is total is always less than twice the log base 2 of n.
    the num of 1 is at most $\lceil \log_2 n\rceil$.
    So total is $\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor+\lceil \log_2 n\rceil<2(\log_2 n+1)$.
    Notice if $frac(\log_2 n)<0.5$, then the above is bigger than $2\log_2 n$.
    - $\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor$ can be intuitively seen as square-rooting the number until the leading 1 is left.
      While $\lceil \log_2 n\rceil$ will go one more step to count the bit digit number.
    - since $R(n)\in [\overbrace{\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor+1}^{1000\ldots 000},\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor+\lceil \log_2 n\rceil]\Rightarrow R(n)=\Theta(\log n)$

  It only counts `expmod` and if for `fast-prime?` we use `n-1` times then the "order of growth" is worse $\Theta(n\log n)$.

  This can also find the "fixed point" if it exists.
  [See](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/9181/1059606)
  - [proof][Banach_fixed_point_proof]
    - Here T is continuous is due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_continuity#Definition_of_uniform_continuity
      notice "uniformly continuous" is for $(x,y)$ while (ordinary) continuity is for $x$
      - compared with [normal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function)
        > Continuity of real functions is usually defined *in terms of limits*. A function f with variable x is continuous at the real number c, if the *limit* of ${\displaystyle f(x),}$ as x tends to c, is equal to ${\displaystyle f(c).}$
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)#In_functions is same as the above "Definition of (ordinary) continuity" where $d$ becomes absolute function $d(x,y)=|x-y|$.
    - The above is similar to the QA answer.
    - In summary it first
      > This proves that the sequence ${\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}$ is *Cauchy*
      then "completeness" (with Cauchy, we get the limit) -> "Furthermore" (existence) -> "Lastly" (unique)
      So we *only* need to prove "Cauchy sequence" and the rest all *follows*.
  - This question has one good wikipedia reference ([link at that time](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banach_fixed-point_theorem&oldid=363078964) proof is almost similar to the current one) but it asks how to calculate limit which is easy as the [top answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/9158/1059606) says.
- TODO
  - > not as far from y as x/y
    Here "average" should be "as far".
    - So interestingly and subtly, This intuitive average *still* holds one *reasonable* "fixed point" definition
    $\frac{1}{2}(y+x/y)=y\Rightarrow y=x/y$
      Then I read
      > (Note that y = 12 (y + x/y) is a simple transformation of the equation y = x/y; to derive it, add y to both sides of the equation and divide by 2.)
- > With this modification, the square-root procedure works.
  Here $y_0=1>0$ then $y_n>\sqrt{x},n\ge 1$
  Then 
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    y_{n+2}-y_{n+1}&=\frac{1}{2}[(y_{n+1}-y_{n})+\frac{x}{y_{n+1}}-\frac{x}{y_{n}}]\\
                   &=\frac{1}{2}(y_{n+1}-y_{n})(1+x\cdot(-\frac{1}{y_{n}y_{n+1}}))\\
                   &<\frac{1}{2}(y_{n+1}-y_{n})
  \end{align*}
  $$
  So it is one Cauchy sequence as [Banach_fixed_point_proof] shows (Here $||$ meets the 1st inequality $d(x_{m},x_{n})\leq d(x_{m},x_{m-1})+d(x_{m-1},x_{m-2})+\cdots +d(x_{n+1},x_{n})$).
  - Here the inequity is inappropriate to catch with python since no program knows where to stop scaling (even for human, we only at the last step know how to scale).
    ```python
    from sympy import symbols
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    from sympy import simplify
    next_y=lambda x,y: 1/2*(x/y+y)
    y_n=next_y(x,y)
    y_nn=next_y(x,y_n)
    for i in range(10):
      print(simplify((y_nn-y_n)/(y_n-y)))
      y=y_n
      y_n=y_nn
      y_nn=next_y(x,y_nn)
    ```

### 1.2
- Here as CS61AS says, we assume `sort` can sort the sequence from low to high correctly.
  ```scheme
  (insert (first sent)
    (sort (bf sent)) )))
  ```
  Then `(insert num sent)` -> `(insert num (bf sent))` just inserts the number at the correct position.
- > Well, if there are K numbers in the argument to insert, how many comparisons does it do? K of them.
How many times do we call insert? N times. But it’s a little tricky because each call to insert has a
different length sentence. The range is from 0 to N − 1.

  Here it means `sent` in `(insert num sent)` has K numbers.
  Based on the context of "The range is from 0 to N − 1.", here it means `sort` is called N times.
  And each `sort` calls `insert` which in turn calls smaller `insert`.

      for each row $n$ indexed from 0, we calculate the middle part ($n-1$ additions)
