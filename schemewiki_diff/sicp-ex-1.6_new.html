  <p>Exercise 1.6. Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form. ``Why can't I just define
    it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?'' she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be
    done, and she defines a new version of if:
  </p>
  <pre> (define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
   (cond (predicate then-clause)
         (else else-clause)))
</pre>
  <p>Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
  </p>
  <pre> (new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
 5
</pre>
  <pre> (new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
 0
</pre>
  <p>Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:
  </p>
  <pre> (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
   (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
           guess
           (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                      x)))
</pre>
  <p>What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>The default if statement is a special form which means that even when an interpreter follows applicative
    substitution, it only evaluates one of its parameters- not both. However, the newly created new-if doesn't have this
    property and hence, it never stops calling itself due to the third parameter passed to it in sqrt-iter.
  </p>
  <p>To be even clearer: The act of re-defining a special form using generic arguments effectively &quot;De-Special
    Forms&quot; it. It then becomes subject to applicative-order evaluation, such that any expressions within the
    consequent or alternate portions are evaluated regardless of the predicate. In Ex 1.6, the iteration procedure is
    called without return and eventually overflows the stack causing an out of memory error.

      <p><tt>new-if</tt> does not use normal order evaluation, it uses applicative order evaluation. That is, the
        interpreter first evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting procedure to the resulting
        arguments. As with Excercise 1.5, this results in an infinite recursion because the <tt>else-clause</tt> is
        always evaluated, thus calling the procedure again ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p>The <tt>if</tt> statement is a special form and behaves differently. <tt>if</tt> first evalutes the predictate,
        and <em>then</em> evaluates either the consequent (if the predicate evalutes to <tt>#t</tt>) <em>or</em> the
        alternative (if the predicate evalues to <tt>#f</tt>). This is key difference from <tt>new-if</tt> -- only
        <em>one</em> of the two consequent expressions get evaluated when using <tt>if</tt>, while <em>both</em> of the
        consequent expressions get evaluated with <tt>new-if</tt>.

          <p>But if <tt>if</tt> works the way that you suggest, why does the very first example in wjm's link generate

          <p>Evaluating <tt>(try 0 (/ 1 0))</tt> generates an error in Scheme. If <tt>if</tt> only evaluates the

          <p>I don't have an alternative explanation - this exercise is stumping me. The applicative vs. normal

              <p>Ah, I finally figured it out. You are right. I'm going to keep my question (and this additional
                response) though because maybe others will have made the same mistake.
              </p>
              <p>The reason the above example generates an error is because <tt>(1 / 0)</tt>, the second parameter to
                <tt>try</tt>, is evaluated before the <tt>try</tt> is even called. The <tt>if</tt> in the body of
                <tt>try</tt> is actually irrelevant. An error would be generated even if <tt>try</tt> did not use the
                value of <tt>b</tt> at all.
              </p>
              <p>As you note, Scheme behaves this way in general due to applicative ordering - parameters are evaluated
                before the operation is carried out. <tt>if</tt> is an exception where the &quot;parameters&quot; are
                not evaluated unless needed. So if we say instead:
              </p>
              <pre>(define (try a)
  (if (= a 0) 1 (/ 1 0))
</pre>
              <p>Calling <tt>(try 0)</tt> does not result in an error, because the else-clause is never evaluated.

      <p>I agree with jsdalton. The reason why new-if runs out of memory is applicative order evaluation, so if the
        plain-old <tt>if</tt> uses applicative order evaluation, it should not work either.
      </p>
      <p>And I guess for a certain interpreter, maybe it should use a consistent way for all processes?

      <p>I believe the above two posters are right and the given answer is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>It's stated clearly in the text that:
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation, partly because of the additional efficiency obtained from
        avoiding multiple evaluations of expressions such as those illustrated with (+ 5 1) and (* 5 2) above and, more
        significantly, because normal-order evaluation becomes much more complicated to deal with when we leave the
        realm of procedures that can be modeled by substitution.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>So I don't see a reason why MIT-Scheme (which is supposedly what readers of the book use) would be any
        different. Plus, as andersc wrote, an interpreter would have to be consistent about the evaluation strategy it
        uses.
      </p>
      <p>As jsdalton said. <tt>new-if</tt> is a procedure, not a special-form, which means that all sub-expressions are
        evaluated before <tt>new-if</tt> is applied to the values of the operands. That includes <tt>sqrt-iter</tt>
        which is extended to <tt>new-if</tt> which again leads to the evaluation of all the sub-expressions including
        <tt>sqrt-iter</tt> etc. Instead, in <tt>if</tt> only one of the consequent expressions is evaluated each time.

      <p>I believe the original solution and the comments by previous posters are incorrect. new-if is a procedure, and
        under applicative-order evaluation, <strong>all</strong> its arguments will be evaluated first
        <strong>before</strong> the procedure application is even started. The third argument to the new-if procedure,
        i.e. the recursive call to sqrt-iter, will <strong>always</strong> be evaluated. It is the evaluation of this
        third argument that causes an infinite loop. In particular, the else-clause mentioned by jsdalton is never
        evaluated. Indeed, the new-if procedure body (which contains the cond special form) is never even applied to the
        resulting 3 arguments as the 3rd argument never stops evaluating itself!

          <p>Page 23: &quot;This process continues until a predicate is found whose value is true, in which case the
            interpreter returns the value of the corresponding consequent expression...&quot;
          </p>
          <p>Take note that it says nothing about evaluating the consequent expression at this point, only returning the
            value. I believe that the consequent expressions are evaluated first in the case of cond. Now look at the
            wording for if:
          </p>
          <p>Page 24: To evaluate an if expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the âŸ¨predicateâŸ© part of the
            expression. If the âŸ¨predicateâŸ© evaluates to a true value, the interpreter then evaluates the âŸ¨consequentâŸ©
            and returns its value.
          </p>
          <p>Take note that in the case of if, it explicitly states that the interpreter evaluates the consequent if
            (and only if) its corresponding predicate is true. That is quite different.

      <p>I think, perhaps, the pretty-print is helping hide the elephant in the room here. In sqrt-iter, the call to
        new-if introduces an infinite recursion. Remember that arguments, if any, are evaluated before a function call.
        In this case, one of the arguments to new-if invokes sqrt-iter recursively and ad infinitum. The new-if
        procedure never executes.

      <p>I think the different between if and new-if,is new-if's &lt;e&gt; maybe a sequence of expressions.
      </p>
      <p>&quot;A minor difference between if and cond is that the &lt;e&gt; part of each cond clause may be a sequence
        of expressions.&quot;from 1.1.7 of SICP.
      </p>
      <p>I am in curiosity for the difference.Does this may result some bugs?

      <p>(define (new-if predicate e1 e2)
      </p>
      <pre>  (cond (predicate e1)
        (else e2)))
</pre>
      <p>If e1 have a ability to generate &quot;a sequence of expressions&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>Then something happened.
