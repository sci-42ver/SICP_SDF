# Chapter 1
Interestingly this chapter compares the computer system with many other systems like biology and physics, etc. (I only read the footnotes about biology detailedly possibly.)
- > Thus a designer may design a compound function and later choose the family for implementation.
  > The families differ in such characteristics as speed and power dissipation, but *not in function*.
  > The families are cross-consistent as well as internally *consistent* in that each function is available in each family, with the same packaging and a consistent nomenclature for description.
  IMHO it means we should construct multiple alternative primitive implementations.
